# cs-296-25-final-project
Final project for CS 296-25 Spring 2019.

The idea is that we compare 5 (or some other number) at a time, that we choose them.

For each cereal, characteristics of the polygon:

- Calories
- Sugars
- Sodium
- Fiber
<!-- - Protein -->

360/n = For n = 5, 72 degrees

Percentage for each characteristic
This percentage gives us the distance from the origin

r = percentage
r cos x
r sin x
